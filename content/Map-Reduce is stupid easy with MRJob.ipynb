      "If you're getting into Hadoop I'm sure you understand that the whole point is that jobs are run across many computers and all of this data has to be transferred from computer to computer as it's processed. The reason that the default return value for the above methods requires your data to be JSON-encodeable is so it's possible to serialize the data to a file and ship it off elsewhere to be further processed. There is a concept known as \"Protocols\" that I won't go into in this post but you should seek out if you find yourself needing a different serialization method.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another concept you're sure to run across is something called \"Combiner\". The sole purpose of a combiner is to reduce network usage. Think about it like this. Imagine the mapper method above creating a file where every instance of every word in all of my log files is inside. That'd be huge right? Basically near the size of my log files with the other data stripped out. But now imagine if I ran a local reduce task that only handled the data on the local computer and THEN sent the results across the network to the computer actually running the full multi-node reducer. Now instead of needing to have thousands of lines for each and every word, I will just have one line for each word with the number of occurences that were found on the current server. Then on the computer doing the real reducing, it can roll up these intermediate results as well.\n",
